Main Project:

Bse Stock data analysis:
	By taking the past data of the stocks we try to analyze them, 
	currently we have taken years.

	Score generation:
		We try to generate a score for each company based on 
		the rise and fall with the base as sensex index value each day.
	
	Finding the correlation: 
		We try to find the performance of the company based on the 
		correlations of the consecutive years to find its consistency.
	
	Finding the mean and Standard deviation for each company
	
	Graph Generation for Last 3 years
	
		Month wise : No of Months V/s Average for each month
		Week wise : No of weeks V/s Average for each week
	
	Weight generation : It says the performance quality in the market
	
		Formulae:
		
		weight = number of companies under-performed than this company
		
		Total weight = average weights of 52 weeks + 
					   average weights of 12 months + 
					   weight of complete year
	
	Testing our weights given to companies:
	
		By taking next one week data and perform the test based on the rank 
		sgenerated on this one week data and compare with total weight generated
